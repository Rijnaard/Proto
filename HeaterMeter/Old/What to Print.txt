There are six .stl's in this directory

There are four bottom files:

	M3		
	M3 FOOTED
	STD
	STD FOOTED

The primary difference between the files is that you have a choice between 
Metric (M3) and Standard (STD) hardware.  Once you choose what hardware you'd 
like to use you need to decide whether you want a foot on the side - so you 
can stand the case up and the probes won't be in the way.

Choose one bottom file.



There are two top files.

	Top
	Top FOOTED

There is no unit associated with the top as it works with either metric or standard hardware.

If you choose a non-footed file, just print the top.  For a footed case, print the Top FOOTED file.

Choose one top file.


What hardware to get?

Well, the metric case takes M3 hardware. You will need:

(4) M3 x 25mm screws
(4) M3 nuts

The standard hardware is:

(4) 4-40 x 1.25" screws
(4) 4-40 nuts

Personally, I perfer Metric hardware - the screw pitch is finer which can be a plus 
if you need to pull the nut into the trap.

I've placed some images in this directory to give you an idea what the case looks like.
